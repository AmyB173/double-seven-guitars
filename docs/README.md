## UX Design

### Strategy - Consumer Goals 
The main goal of the consumer is to find a business that can repair their broken guitar or offer routine maintenance. 

Consumers want a method to understand: 

- If the repair or maintenance they require is offered by the business 
- How to make contact and request a repair
- The location of the repairs 
- If the business has prior experience with said repairs (quality – does it look credible and trustworthy?)
- If the business has been positively reviewed (quality – does it look credible and trustworthy?)
- The cost of any potential repairs 

### Strategy - Business Goals 

- To increase the number of customers deciding to contact for repair 
- To encourage first-time visitors to make a request for services

### Strategy - User Stories

#### First time visitor (novice or experienced)
- As a first time visitor, I want to see the prices clearly, so that I can decide if the repair is in my price range. (A) 
- As a first time visitor, I want to understand how to get in contact, so that I can request a repair on my guitar. (B) 
- As an first time visitor, I want to see the reviews of the business, so that I can see how well-known and liked they are and thus have confidence in the guitar repair (particularly important for experienced guitar owner). (C) 
- As a first time visitor, I want to check the location of the business, so that I can see if it is feasable to drop off/pick up my guitar. 

#### Novice guitar owner (first time visit)
- As a novice guitar owner (first time visit), I want to see a clear and easy-to-understand list of services, so that I can choose the appropriate service. (E) 
- As a novice guitar owner (first time visit), I want to be given information of about types of repairs and maintenance so that I can understand what services I might need. (F)


#### Experienced guitar owner (first time visit)

- As an experienced guitar owner (first time visit), I want to see whether more complicated repairs are available, so that I can decide if my problem can be resolved by the business. (G)
- As an experienced guitar owner (first time visit), I want to see what types of repairs the business has experience in, so that I can trust my more complicated guitar repair with the business. (H)


#### Returning Visitor (second+ repair)
- As a returning visitor, I want to check the contact details again to ensure I have them correct for a request of another repair. (I)

### Strategy - Importance vs Viability 

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| To provide information about the core purpose of the business | 5 | 5 |
| To provide cost information | 5 | 5
| To showcase owner's guitar playing ability | 2 | 5 |
| To increase following to owner's band | 2 | 5
| To showcase the types of repairs completed by the business | 4 | 5
| To highlight good reviews of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide contact details of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide information about the owner's work history as a racecar mechanic | 3 | 5
| Totals | 31 | 40

As these totals are quite different, this has highlighted that not all of these should be implemented. 

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| To provide information about the core purpose of the business | 5 | 5 |
| To provide cost information | 5 | 5
| To showcase the types of repairs completed by the business | 4 | 5
| To highlight good reviews of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide contact details of the business | 5 | 5
| Totals | 24 | 25

By removing three of the opportunities the totals come closer and it has created a more manageable set of goals.

### Scope

To be included in the website: 

- consistent navigation menu and footer so information can be found easily
- a primary information section to explain what the business does 
- an explanation and list of services provided
- some media showing what repairs have been done 
- examples of good reviews
- easily accessible contact information, maybe repeated, to increase the chance of "first-time-purchase" which in this case is a repair request
- a variety of ways to make contact so customers can choose their preferred method
- location information so customers know where to drop off and pick up guitars 

### Structure

All pages will contain navigation links to all pages and a footer with contact information.

The website will contain three pages (plus a 404.html):

- Home Page: this will contain the primary information, some information about services offered and some reviews.

- Services Page: this will contain a list of services and corresponding prices and some videos and images of repairs completed by the business.

- Contact Page: This will include phone number, email adress, facebook link, contact form and location information such as address and map. 

### Skeleton - wireframes

The wireframes below have been adapted slightly, with buttons being added at various places linking back to contact details and the list of services as well as a dropdown menu on the contact navigation link to make it easier to choose the type of contact or choose the location information.

#### Home Page

![Home Page Small Wireframe](./images/wireframes/small-home-page.jpg) ![Home Page Medium Wireframe](./images/wireframes/medium-home-page.jpg) ![Home Page Large Wireframe](./images/wireframes/large-home-page.jpg)

#### Services Page

#### Contact Page

![Contact Page Small and Medium Wireframe](./images/wireframes/small-medium-contact-page.jpg) ![Contact Page Large Wireframe](./images/wireframes/large-contact-page.jpg)


### Surface - Design Choices 

#### Colour Scheme

The main business logo has been discarded (with owners permission): 

![Original Double Seven Logo](./images/Logo-v2.png)

But the 77 element has been retained as the logo for the website:

![77 Logo](./images/77-no-background.png)

This colour palette is inspired by the business logo which features red, black and grey. 

![Colour Palette for the website- red and black inspired](./images/double-seven-colours.png)

#### Typography 

I have used google fonts and chosen "Dosis":

![Dosis Font Example](./images/Dosis%20Font.png)

For the typography used for the brand name I used www.picturetopeople.org to generate a more unique looking font as an image with a clear background: 

![Font used for brand name on hero image](./images/hero-font.png)

## Features

### Footer

This is common to all pages, contains contact details and the facebook icon links to the business facebook page: 

![Footer of home page](images/footer.png)

### Navigation Bar
This is common to all pages. Navigation bar that uses the business logo as a link for the home page. The navigation link are on the right side and the active page is a different colour and made larger: 

![Navigation bar](images/nav-bar.png)
On a mobile device the navigation links collapse: 

![Mobile Navigation Bar](images/nav-bar-mobile.png)

The contact navigation link has a further dropdown so preferred communication can be chose and so location is easily found: 

![Contact link dropdown](images/contact-dropdown.png)


### Home Page


#### Hero image and title 

The hero image is overlapped by the title image: 

![Hero image on desktop](images/hero-desktop.png)

On a mobile the title is presented vertically and a different image was used with a different ratio to make everything look more proportional: 

![Hero image on mobile](images/hero-mobile.png)

#### Primary information section

This section sits underneath the hero and is designed to tell the user about the business straight away. It has a button that takes you to the contact page to increase the chance of a first-time-visit purchase:

![Primary Information Section](images/primary-info-section.png)

It is responsive a shrinks with the screen size and margin is maintained: 

![Mobile primary information section](images/primary-info-section-mobile.png)

#### Services Section 

This sections includes a dark grey banner that appear, consistnetly, on all pages. Services are bulleted with icons and button that leads directly to the table of services on the services page:

![Services section of home page](images/services-section.png)

It is responsive on smaller screens: 

![Services section of home page on mobile](images/services-section-mobile.png)

#### Testimonials Section 

This section includes the common banner and features three good reviews:

![Testimonials Section](images/testimonials-section.png)

Responsive on a medium screen: 

![Testimonials section medium screen](images/testimonials-section-medium.png)

Responsive on a mobile - on these smaller screens the testimonals appear as a carousel for people to click through: 

![Testimonials section on a mobile feating a carousel](images/testimonials-section-mobile.png)



### Services Page


#### Services hero image

The services hero image appears under the navigation bar and above the services table section: 

![Services page hero image](images/services-hero.png)

On a mobile the proportions of the hero image are slightly different:

![Service page hero image on mobile](images/services-hero-mobile.png)

#### Table of services 
The table of services sits under the commonly styled banner (see home page). Hovering over the table rows makes the background the double seven red colour and the text white. There is a button that takes you to the contact page if you would like to request a service. 

![List of services provided by double seven guitars](images/services-table.png)

#### Video and gallery section

Underneath another banner there is a video to showcase an example repair: 

![Services page video section](images/services-video.png)

Underneath the video sits the gallery section. On a hover or click the cards in the gallery section get an opaque black overlay and get slowly larger and slowly smaller when hover is removed or a click happens elsewhere: 

![Gallery section showing one image with an opaque black overlay and slightly larger](images/services-gallery.png)

The gallery is responsive and on a medium screen looks like: 

![Gallery section on medium screen](images/services-gallery-medium.png)

On a mobile device the cards stack on top of each other and look like this: 

![Gallery section on a mobile](images/services-gallery-mobile.png)

### Contact Page

#### Contact Boxes

At the top of the contact page there are three boxes showing forms of contact. The red facebook button has a border to the right and to the bottom to add "affordance" and make it look more clickable than the others. In future implementations, I would want the phone and email to be clickable instantly copy to the person's device. 

![Contact boxes on the contact page](images/contact-boxes.png)

On a medium screen:

![Contact boxes on a medium screen](images/contact-boxes-medium.png)

And stacked on top of each other on a mobile: 

![Contact boxes on a mobile screen](images/contact-boxes-mobile.png)

#### Address and map

The top of this section has the common banner.
This sections features the address in a box in the same style as the contact boxes and an embedded google map underneath.

![Address and map section](images/address-map.png)

The map is responsive and shrinks to fit mobile: 

![Address and map section on mobile](images/address-map-mobile.png)

### 404.html Page

The 404 page has a whimsical/jokey message and a button to return to the main home page:

![404 page](images/404-page.png)

The page is responsive on a mobile: 

![404 page on mobile](images/404-page-mobile.png)


## Tools and Technologies Used
 - Custom HTML and CSS were used throughout.
 - [Boostrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) was used in this project at various points for layout, form styling, creating cards and the navbar. I made some adaptations to the bootstrap styling at various points too. 
 - CSS Flexbox was also used for layout purposes (outside of bootstrap) - the reason I used flexbox without bootstrap was that it felt lighter and more customisable in places in addition to giving me good practice of using both flexbox and bootstrap for layout. 
 - Git for version control
 - Github for saving and storing files
 - VS Code for locally coding my project (to replace the use of online IDE such as gitpod or codeanywhere)
 - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the font used in the website
 - Google developer tools to to test the wesbite for responsiveness and to fix bugs.
 - [Picture to people](https://www.picturetopeople.org/text_generator/others/transparent/transparent-text-generator.html "Picture to People website") was used to generate the title with transparent background that overlays the hero image. 
 - [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com "Image Resizer Website") was used to compress and resize images. 
 - [Convertio](https://convertio.co/) for turning jpg to webp
 - [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors Website") was used to generate the colour pallete. 
 - Google Maps API to embed a map using an iframe.
 - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for all icons used in my page.
 - [Am I Responsive?](https://www.google.com/search?q=am+i+responsive&rlz=1C1ONGR_en-GBGB985GB985&oq=am+i+respon&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgYIARBFGDkyBggCEEUYQDIGCAMQRRhBMgYIBBBFGDwyBggFEEUYPNIBCDE4NTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to show how the website looks on different size screens and devices.
 - WAVE chrome extension for accessibility testing
 - WCAG Contrast checker chrome extension for colour constrast checking
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for validating html and css
