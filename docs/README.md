## UX Design

### Strategy - Consumer Goals 
The main goal of the consumer is to find a business that can repair their broken guitar or offer routine maintenance. 

Consumers want a method to understand: 

- If the repair or maintenance they require is offered by the business 
- How to make contact and request a repair
- The location of the repairs 
- If the business has prior experience with said repairs (quality – does it look credible and trustworthy?)
- If the business has been positively reviewed (quality – does it look credible and trustworthy?)
- The cost of any potential repairs 

### Strategy - Business Goals 

- To increase the number of customers deciding to contact for repair 
- To encourage first-time visitors to make a request for services

### Strategy - User Stories

#### First time visitor (novice or experienced)
- As a first time visitor, I want to see the prices clearly, so that I can decide if the repair is in my price range. (A) 
- As a first time visitor, I want to understand how to get in contact, so that I can request a repair on my guitar. (B) 
- As an first time visitor, I want to see the reviews of the business, so that I can see how well-known and liked they are and thus have confidence in the guitar repair (particularly important for experienced guitar owner). (C) 
- As a first time visitor, I want to check the location of the business, so that I can see if it is feasable to drop off/pick up my guitar. 

#### Novice guitar owner (first time visit)
- As a novice guitar owner (first time visit), I want to see a clear and easy-to-understand list of services, so that I can choose the appropriate service. (E) 
- As a novice guitar owner (first time visit), I want to be given information of about types of repairs and maintenance so that I can understand what services I might need. (F)


#### Experienced guitar owner (first time visit)

- As an experienced guitar owner (first time visit), I want to see whether more complicated repairs are available, so that I can decide if my problem can be resolved by the business. (G)
- As an experienced guitar owner (first time visit), I want to see what types of repairs the business has experience in, so that I can trust my more complicated guitar repair with the business. (H)


#### Returning Visitor (second+ repair)
- As a returning visitor, I want to check the contact details again to ensure I have them correct for a request of another repair. (I)

### Strategy - Importance vs Viability 

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| To provide information about the core purpose of the business | 5 | 5 |
| To provide cost information | 5 | 5
| To showcase owner's guitar playing ability | 2 | 5 |
| To increase following to owner's band | 2 | 5
| To showcase the types of repairs completed by the business | 4 | 5
| To highlight good reviews of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide contact details of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide information about the owner's work history as a racecar mechanic | 3 | 5
| Totals | 31 | 40

As these totals are quite different, this has highlighted that not all of these should be implemented. 

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| To provide information about the core purpose of the business | 5 | 5 |
| To provide cost information | 5 | 5
| To showcase the types of repairs completed by the business | 4 | 5
| To highlight good reviews of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide contact details of the business | 5 | 5
| Totals | 24 | 25

By removing three of the opportunities the totals come closer and it has created a more manageable set of goals.

### Scope

To be included in the website: 

- consistent navigation menu and footer so information can be found easily
- a primary information section to explain what the business does 
- an explanation and list of services provided
- some media showing what repairs have been done 
- examples of good reviews
- easily accessible contact information, maybe repeated, to increase the chance of "first-time-purchase" which in this case is a repair request
- a variety of ways to make contact so customers can choose their preferred method
- location information so customers know where to drop off and pick up guitars 

### Structure

All pages will contain navigation links to all pages and a footer with contact information.

The website will contain three pages (plus a 404.html):

- Home Page: this will contain the primary information, some information about services offered and some reviews.

- Services Page: this will contain a list of services and corresponding prices and some videos and images of repairs completed by the business.

- Contact Page: This will include phone number, email adress, facebook link, contact form and location information such as address and map. 

### Skeleton - wireframes

The wireframes below have been adapted slightly, with buttons being added at various places linking back to contact details and the list of services as well as a dropdown menu on the contact navigation link to make it easier to choose the type of contact or choose the location information.

#### Home Page

#### Contact Page

### Surface - Design Choices 

#### Colour Scheme

The main business logo has been discarded (with owners permission): 

![Original Double Seven Logo](./images/Logo-v2.png)

But the 77 element has been retained as the logo for the website:

![77 Logo](./images/77-no-background.png)

This colour palette is inspired by the business logo which features red, black and grey. 

![Colour Palette for the website- red and black inspired](./images/double-seven-colours.png)

#### Typography 

I have used google fonts and chosen "Dosis":

![Dosis Font Example](./images/Dosis%20Font.png)

For the typography used for the brand name I used www.picturetopeople.org to generate a more unique looking font as an image with a clear background: 

![Font used for brand name on hero image](./images/hero-font.png)


#### Imagery TBD

Images provided by the business. 

## Features

This website has three pages: a home page (index.html), a services page and a contact page. The homepage contains some information that is also in the services and contact page. The rationale for this is that business to consumer websites tend to sees customers making a "purchase on their first visit. In this contest, a purchase constitutes making a request for a repair via one of the three contact channels (phone, email, website form). To encourage contact, contact details are made easily available on every page. All users share the common requirement of understand what services are offered so there is some overlap of content between the homepage and the services page in case some users are too impatient to find the services page and to really encourage first-visit purchasing. 

#### Common features on all pages

- A navigation bar that includes the double seven logo on the left. This navigates to the home page. This is common practice and consequently provides a good user experience for the user. The right of the navigation bar features the three links to all pages, with the active page underlined to ensure users know which page they are on, avoiding confusing navigation, and allow for good user experience. The navigation bar collapses to a toggler with a burger icon on small screens to avoid the navigation bar looking cluttered. The burger icon is common practice and users will expect this. 

- A footer that is styled consistently with the navigation bar. The footer contains a link to facebook using the facebook icon to ensure a clear and uncluttered look. The icon is what users expect to see and knows where it leads them. On the right of the navigation bar, there is the phone number and email address (to ensure as few steps as possible between the desire to have a repair and finding the details to make the request).

- If scrolling is required, then the top of the next section is always visible at all screen sizes so the user knows that there is more content available.

#### Home page
- Hero Image - a clean, professional looking image of a guitar with the double seven logo overlayed clearly. The background image is dark and contrasts well with the logo to allow for a clean look. 
- Primary info - there is a small descriptive section that describes what the business is. 
- Services section - a description of the type of services offered, a link to the full services page and video of a repair. 
- Testimonials section - positive reviews of the business only displayed on screens of medium size or bigger. 
- On large or extra-large screens, the hero image and primary info are presented side by side.

## Tools and Technologies Used
 - Custom HTML and CSS were used throughout.
 - [Boostrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) was used in this project at various points for layout, form styling, creating cards and the navbar. I made some adaptations to the bootstrap styling at various points too. 
 - CSS Flexbox was also used for layout purposes (outside of bootstrap) - the reason I used flexbox without bootstrap was that it felt lighter and more customisable in places in addition to giving me good practice of using both flexbox and bootstrap for layout. 
 - [Picture to people](https://www.picturetopeople.org/text_generator/others/transparent/transparent-text-generator.html "Picture to People website") was used to generate the title with transparent background that overlays the hero image. 
 - [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com "Image Resizer Website") was used to compress and resize images. 
 - [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors Website") was used to generate the colour pallete. 
 - Google Maps API to embed a map using an iframe.
 - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for all icons used in my page.
