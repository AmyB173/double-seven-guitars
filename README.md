## UX Design

### Consumer Goals 
The main goal of the consumer is to find a business that can repair their broken guitar or offer routine maintenance. Priorities for the consumer will be quality of repairs, costs of repairs and timescale of repairs.

Consumers want a method to understand: 

- If the repair or maintenance they require is offered by the business (does it offer what I want?)
- How to make contact and request a repair (purchase – what actions can I take now? How do I contact someone?) 
- The location of the repairs (is it feasible? – does it offer what I want?)
- If the business has prior experience with said repairs (quality – does it look credible and trustworthy?)
- If the business has been positively reviewed (quality – does it look credible and trustworthy?)
- The cost of any potential repairs 
- The timescale

### Business Goals

- To increase the number of customers deciding to contact for repair 
- To make it easy for customers to access and request repairs
